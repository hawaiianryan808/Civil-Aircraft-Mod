The Airbus A320neo (New Engine Option) is an evolution of the A320ceo, featuring large, fuel-efficient engines and aerodynamic refinements. The "neo" utilizes geared turbofan technology (PW1100G) or advanced core architecture (CFM LEAP) to deliver a 15-20% reduction in fuel consumption per seat. It is easily identified by its massive engines and standard "Sharklet" wingtips, which reduce drag and improve takeoff performance. The cabin features the "Airspace by Airbus" interior, offering larger overhead bins and modern LED lighting. Since its introduction in 2016, it has become the fastest-selling commercial aircraft in history.
