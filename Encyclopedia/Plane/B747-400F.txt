The Boeing 747-400F is the all-cargo production variant of the 747-400, distinguished by its shorter "hump" (upper deck) compared to the passenger version to save weight. It features a large hinged nose door that swings upward, allowing extra-long or oversized cargo to be loaded directly into the main deck. The floor is strengthened and equipped with a powered cargo handling system to maneuver pallets and containers. Unlike converted passenger 747s (BCF), the factory-built 400F lacks passenger windows and has a dedicated side cargo door. With a payload capacity of approximately 113,000 kg (248,600 lb), it remains a backbone of the global air freight industry.
