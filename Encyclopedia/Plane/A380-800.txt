The Airbus A380-800 is the largest passenger airliner in the world, featuring a full-length double-deck fuselage. Entering service in 2007 with Singapore Airlines, it was designed to challenge the monopoly of the Boeing 747 in the long-haul hub-to-hub market. The aircraft utilizes advanced materials, including Glare (glass-reinforced aluminum), to reduce weight despite its immense size. Its wing area is 54% larger than that of the Boeing 747-400, providing sufficient lift for its 1.2 million pound takeoff weight without requiring extreme takeoff speeds. Due to its size, airports required modifications to gates and taxiways (Code F) to accommodate its 80-meter wingspan.
