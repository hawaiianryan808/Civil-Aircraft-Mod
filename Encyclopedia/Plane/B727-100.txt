The Boeing 727-100 is the original short-body variant of the only trijet ever produced by Boeing. Designed to serve smaller airports with shorter runways, it features a unique high-lift wing system with triple-slotted flaps and leading-edge devices that allow for remarkably low approach speeds. The three engines are mounted at the rear: two on pylons and the third fed by an S-duct through the tail fin. It is equipped with a ventral airstair under the tail, which allowed passenger boarding without ground support equipment, a key feature for 1960s regional operations. The 727-100 entered service in 1964 and was the first jetliner to undergo rigorous fatigue testing during certification.
