The Airbus A330-300 is a medium-to-long-range twinjet that shares its avionics and cockpit layout with the quad-jet A340. Optimized for high-density routes, the -300 has a longer fuselage than the -200 but a slightly shorter range. It was the first Airbus variant to offer a choice of three engine manufacturers (GE, Pratt & Whitney, and Rolls-Royce). The 242-tonne MTOW variant, introduced later in its life cycle, significantly improved its range capability, allowing it to compete effectively on Transpacific routes. It remains one of the most efficient aircraft for regional Asian and Transatlantic sectors.
