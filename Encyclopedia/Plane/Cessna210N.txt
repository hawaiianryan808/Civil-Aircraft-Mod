The Cessna P210N is a pressurized version of the popular 210 Centurion, manufactured between 1978 and 1983. It features a distinctive high-wing design with retractable landing gear, allowing for a clean aerodynamic profile and higher cruise speeds compared to fixed-gear rivals. The "P" in the designation stands for "Pressurized," utilizing bleed air from the turbocharger to maintain a cabin altitude of 8,000 ft at an aircraft altitude of 23,000 ft. It eliminates the need for supplemental oxygen masks for passengers during high-altitude cruise, a rare luxury in single-engine piston aircraft of its era. The P210N is widely regarded as one of the most capable personal cross-country machines ever built, often cited for its ability to fly over weather that would ground non-turbocharged aircraft.
